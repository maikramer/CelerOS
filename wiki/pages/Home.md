CelerOS is a lightweight, open-source GUI operating system with a JavaScript
app runtime for ESP32 microcontrollers. It turns cheap display boards into a
small "smartwatch-grade" device: an immediate-mode UI on top of LovyanGFX, a
Duktape JS engine running sandboxed apps from flash or SD, an App Store with
over-the-air updates, and a USB companion tool (`celerctl`) for day-to-day
development.

## What's new

Highlights of the October 2026 rounds (firmware 1.8, JS API level 27):

* **The pack ("matilha")** — devices discover each other and form a **multi-hop Bluetooth mesh** (CelerNet, API 26–27): every node relays by itself, presence carries each device's role, messages travel direct or broadcast up to 434 B across up to 8 hops, and the **Pack** hands the **playing chiptune to the neighbour with a speaker** — from the exact same beat ([mesh page](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Pack-Mesh)).
* **Six apps that live on the mesh** (App Store): **Sonar** (radar by rings of hops, real RTT ping/loss, census), **Batata Quente** (hot potato by unicast), **Mural** (message board that reaches devices that were **off**, via Trickle), **Sentinela** (IMU/mic watchdog with two-way alarm), **Coral** (4-voice choir with synchronised entry) and **Pong Duplo** (mirrored pong over the Celer Link) ([mesh page](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Pack-Mesh)).
* **Bench-hardened radio (3 boards)** — fragmented unicast now actually arrives (copies patch each other's lost fragments), relays step out of the burst's way and self-cancel, the radio arbitrates mesh × Celer Link × app scans, and Wi-Fi roaming only scans when the signal is weak (a connected scan deafened Bluetooth ~9 s every 39 s).
* **RAM to live with the pack** — measured stacks, `.bss` off to PSRAM on the S3 boards, CelerLink retry leak fixed: the watch holds mesh + phone link + Wi-Fi without starving internal RAM.
* **meshsim in CI** — the mesh apps run **for real on N simulated nodes** in the host suite: lockstep virtual clock, an air that models TTL/hops, fragments with per-link loss, the 96-packet all-or-nothing TX queue, Pack envelopes and Celer Link pairing.

Firmware 1.7, earlier in October: the **talking dog** — `AI.speak()` TTS played live (API 24), the LLM writing its own choreography (`dog_script`), the hop gait with the belly spin, AI barks in QOA, **celerctl over Wi-Fi** (Debug Bridge + `provision`), `celerctl top` profiling, persistent `/local/log` logs and a robustness round through the runtime.

Firmware 1.6: the **UI toolkit** (`UI.*`, API 22), **multi-file apps** with `require()` (API 23), **voice 2.0** and **Celer Link sealed** with AES-GCM frames (API 21).

Earlier in the 1.5 cycle: on-device AI (`AI.chat`, API 18–20), voice and the **wake word "Hi Celer"** on-device (API 19–20), the JavaScript debugger over USB, watch deep sleep with a ULP-RISC-V sentinel, **Phone Link** over Gadgetbridge (`Phone.*`, API 15), **watchface plugins** (API 16), runtime APIs 12–17, the barebone devkit board, the **CelerOS Flasher** and the **App SDK**.

## Feature summary

* **JavaScript app runtime** — interactive ES5 apps run natively on Duktape
  (API level 20): canvas-style drawing, touch and the coupled on-screen
  keyboard, file system, HTTP/JSON networking.
* **On-device AI & voice** — `AI.chat()` talks to DeepSeek or OpenRouter
  from any app (async, TLS, function calling; keys stay outside the JS
  sandbox), `Mic.*` records 16 kHz WAV behind a `mic` permission, and the
  bundled **Chat IA** and **Qwen** apps are a chat client and a push-to-talk
  voice assistant. On the robot dog the wake word **"Hi Celer"** runs
  on-device and voice commands ("hi celer, senta") drive the legs
  (`WakeWord.*`, API 20 — [robot dog](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Robot-Dog)).
* **JavaScript debugger** — `celerctl debug MyApp`: Duktape debugger over
  USB with breakpoints, stepping, eval, watches and an automatic pause on
  uncaught errors ([tools](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Tools)).
* **Immediate-mode UI** — the same apps scale from 240x320 up to 480x480.
* **System apps in JS** — Settings, App Store, Installer, Help, Web Server,
  Terminal, Snake, Chat IA, Qwen and the demos live in the LittleFS
  partition; boards overlay their home apps (Watchface, Dog Face, Barebone).
* **App Store & Installer** — install apps from the
  [CelerOS Hub](https://os.celer.tec.br) over Wi-Fi or from the SD card.
* **Over-the-air updates** — from the device itself, from the browser or via
  `celerctl ota push`.
* **Live screen from the browser** — `/screen` mirrors the display over
  Wi-Fi and forwards your clicks as touches.
* **Board hardware in JS** — RGB LED, light sensor with auto-brightness,
  speaker (`System.beep`), relay lines and servos (`System.gpio.servo`) on
  supported boards; robot boards add battery, microphone, capacitive touch
  pad and NeoPixel (`System.battery`/`micLevel`/`touchPad`/`neopixel`);
  the watch adds an IMU with pedometer and raise-to-wake
  (`Sensors.accel/steps/temp`), a battery, an RTC that keeps time without
  network and audio volume (`System.setVolume`); the headless devkit
  exposes the BOOT button (`System.button()`, API 17).
* **Watch-grade power management** — the screen ladder dims after a few
  seconds, falls back to an always-on face with anti burn-in, then goes to
  automatic deep sleep guarded by a ULP-RISC-V sentinel that watches the
  buttons, the battery and the cable (PWR wakes it in ~100 ms); the watch
  boots straight into its watch face.
* **Celer Link (BLE)** — a Bluetooth LE link between nearby CelerOS devices
  (API 9): a board on a robot runs `CelerLink.start()`, another one drives it
  with `scan()`/`connect()`/`send()` — see the
  [robot dog](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Robot-Dog) page and the Celer Remote
  app in the hub. Since API 11 it pairs with a 6-digit code and a
  challenge-response key per bond. Runs on the SmartDisplay, the watch and
  the robot dog.
* **Phone Link (Gadgetbridge)** — the watch pairs with Android over BLE
  posing as a Bangle.js: notifications with a full-screen alert, music
  control, weather, incoming calls and find-my-phone (`Phone.*`, API 15 —
  [watch page](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Waveshare-Watch)).
* **Notifications & alarms** — a system notification center (`System.notify`;
  on the watch an incoming notification wakes the screen) and persistent
  alarms with their own ringing screen (API 15).
* **Watchface plugins** — installed apps extend the watch face with widget
  lines (`watchface.js` + `System.launchApp`, API 16 —
  [plugins page](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Watchface-Plugins)).
* **CelerOS Flasher & App SDK** — no-toolchain GUI flashing from
  [GitHub releases](https://github.com/maikramer/CelerOS/releases), and
  `tools/sdk/celer.js` for scaffolding, linting, emulating (one PNG per
  clock milestone with pixel diffs) and publishing apps
  ([tools](/maikramer/CelerOS/wiki/Tools)).
* **Wi-Fi via captive portal** — a `CelerOS-Setup-XXXX` access point to
  configure it from your phone.
* **`celerctl`** — an adb-style USB companion: shell, push/pull, logcat
  (timestamps, filters, non-destructive dump), the JS debugger, screencap
  and in-place firmware updates. The last app error persists to
  `/local/lastcrash.txt` (`lasterror` in the shell).
