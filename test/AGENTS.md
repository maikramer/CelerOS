# test/ - host test suites (what CI runs before any firmware build)

## OVERVIEW
Six suites, all host-side (Node/Python/g++), no hardware needed. They are the gate for every push: `.github/workflows/build.yml` runs them in the `JS harness + C++ host tests` job and a red job blocks the firmware matrix. `test/README` is a stale PlatformIO leftover — this file replaces it.

## SUITES
| Suite | Runs | Command |
|-------|------|---------|
| `js_harness/` | The REAL app JS (data/apps, hub_apps, boards/*/data/apps) against a stubbed device API: System/Net/FS/Storage/Sensors/Phone + harness channel. Smoke + behavior checks per app (App Store update flows, Dog Face gaits, Celer Remote, API 12 timers/Storage, API 15 watch apps...) | `node test/js_harness/run.js` |
| `app_lint/` | Linter fixtures: syntax, unknown API members, arities (min inferred from C++ bodies), permissions/gates, globals, manifest self-test (>=100 fns parsed, every C++ body found) | `node test/app_lint/run.js` |
| `sdk/` | The app-dev SDK: scaffold manifest, types coverage, renderer, emulator | `node test/sdk/run.js` |
| `debug/` | App debugger: dmsg codec/stream (`tools/debug/dmsg.js`) and the REPL client (`dbg.js`) scripted against a FAKE Duktape target over TCP (vm-backed Eval, breakpoints, conditional/temp, uncaught-error pause, `r` restart + side-channel sync, Detaching) | `node test/debug/run.js` |
| `test_celerctl.py` | celerctl (HostLink client) against a FakeDevice — proto 2 framing, window/retry, no hardware | `python3 test/test_celerctl.py` (needs pyserial) |
| `cpp/` | Pure C++ logic: `run_tests.cpp` includes `main/Utils/*` headers directly (AlarmCalc, GbProto, HostFrame framer...) | `g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -o celeros_tests test/cpp/run_tests.cpp && ./celeros_tests` |
| `duk/` | Bindings against the REAL Duktape (host): extracts `js_require` verbatim from `main/Runtime/JsModules.cpp`, builds it with `components/duktape/duktape.c` + the real `JsStripper` and runs `js_harness/fixtures/modapp` with the harness expectations. Catches engine-level bugs the Node harness cannot (the `DUK_COMPILE_FUNCTION` one). Needs gcc; `duktape.o` cached in `test/duk/.build` | `python3 test/duk/run.py` |

## THE DRIFT CHECK (keeps code, docs, stubs and types honest)
`node tools/sdk/celer.js check` cross-references the app_lint manifest (derived from `JSBindings.cpp` tables + `Js*.cpp` bodies + `main/CMakeLists.txt` API level) against `Documentation/JS_API_Guide.pt-BR.md`, the js_harness stubs and `tools/sdk/types/celer.d.ts`. When the JS API changes, regenerate and commit the types: `node tools/sdk/celer.js types`.

## CONVENTIONS
- Adding a JS API call: update `JSBindings` (source of truth), the pt-BR guide heading (`#### System.foo(a, b) (API N)`), the js_harness stub, and regen types — otherwise the drift check or the fixtures fail. The app_lint manifest has no file: it is rebuilt from firmware sources on every run, so never try to hand-edit it.
- New app (anywhere under data/apps, hub_apps, boards/*/data/apps): give it harness coverage in `js_harness/run.js` — the repo lint (`node tools/app_lint/lint.js data/apps hub_apps boards/*/data/apps`) runs automatically over it in CI.
- Arity fixtures (`fixtures/aridade.js`): `min` comes from require-style calls in the C++ body — `duk_require_*` AND helpers shaped `requireXxx(ctx, i)` (requirePin, requireKey). If you rename such a helper, the manifest regresses silently: run the fixture suite.
- Tests are deterministic and fast (<1 min total). If something only reproduces on hardware, it belongs on the bench, not here — but encode the pure logic (parsers, calculators, framing) in `cpp/` instead.
