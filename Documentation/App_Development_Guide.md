# CelerOS App Development Guide

**English** | [Português (BR)](App_Development_Guide.pt-BR.md)

Welcome to the CelerOS App Development Guide! Developing apps for CelerOS is simple. Apps are written in JavaScript and use a standard folder structure containing metadata and code.

## 1. App Folder Structure

In CelerOS, an app is not just a single `.js` file. Instead, every app is a **folder** containing all its necessary files. When you install your app with `celerctl apps install <folder>`, from the SD card (Installer) or through the App Store, the whole folder is what gets deployed.

A standard app folder looks like this:
```text
MyAwesomeApp/
├── app.json
├── icon.png
└── main.js
```

## 2. The `app.json` File (App Metadata)

The `app.json` file is the heart of your app's identity. The CelerOS Installer reads this file to securely install, update, and categorize your application.

### Example Format:
```json
{
  "name": "My App",
  "packageName": "com.developer.myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "metaUrl": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../myapp/app.json",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "description": "A cool app that does awesome things.",
  "type": "App",
  "category": "Utility",
  "api": 6,
  "changelog": "Initial release."
}
```

### Field Details:
- **`name`**: The display name of your app. This is what the user sees in the Home.
- **`packageName`**: A globally unique identifier for your app. **Rules: lowercase, dot-separated style, no spaces** (e.g., `com.yourname.appname`). The OS uses this to detect if your app is already installed.
- **`version`**: Semantic versioning (e.g. `1.0.0`, `1.2.1`). If a user installs an app with the same `packageName` but a higher version number, the OS will smartly prompt them to "Update" rather than "Install".
- **`metaUrl`** *(optional)*: The raw URL to the `app.json` on the internet (e.g. your GitHub repository). Apps published on the **CelerOS Hub don't need it** — the store catalog itself carries name, version, changelog, size and the MD5 checksum of your `main.js`; `metaUrl` is only for self-hosted update checks outside the hub.
- **`author`**: Your name or studio. If someone else tries to install an app with your `packageName` but a different `author` name, the OS will throw a conflict warning to protect your app from being overwritten by malicious developers.
- **`description`**: A short summary of your app, displayed to the user when they install your app for the first time. Accented Latin-1 characters (ç, ã, é...) render fine since API 7; avoid em dashes, curly quotes and emoji (outside the font).
- **`type`**: The broad classification (e.g., `App` or `Game`). You can type any value here without restriction.
- **`category`**: The specific category (e.g., `Utilities`, `Games`, `Tools`). You can type any value here without restriction.
- **Boards without PSRAM** (e.g. the classic CYD): the whole `main.js` — plus the JS heap and the compile temporaries — must fit in internal RAM; a source past ~60KB doesn't compile there (comments and indentation are stripped before compiling, so they cost nothing). Apps bigger than 48 KB must declare `"requires": ["psram"]`; the store badges them "Requer PSRAM" and blocks the install on boards without PSRAM.
- **`permissions`** (optional, F4): array of capabilities — `"fs"`, `"net"`, `"gpio"`, `"system"`. Without the field the app keeps everything (compat with the existing store); with it, only what is declared is registered: `FS` / `Net` / `System.gpio` **plus the external-hardware calls** (`System.led`, `System.relay*`, `System.neopixel`) and the device-affecting calls such as `restart`/`otaStart`. System files under `/local` (WiFi credentials, PIN, OTA/boot config) additionally require `"system"` even for apps with `"fs"`. System apps (`"system": true`) always get everything.
- **`api`**: The CelerOS API level your app targets (see the [JS API Guide](JS_API_Guide.md) — currently `12`). This is verified by the system at install time.
- **`requires`** (optional): hardware requirements — `"psram"` is the only value today. It raises the hub ceiling for `main.js` from 48 KB to 128 KB (boards with PSRAM compile without a runtime limit); the store badges the app "Requer PSRAM" and blocks the install on boards without PSRAM (CYD, devkit). An SD card does **not** raise the ceiling: the limit is compile RAM, not storage.
- **`changelog`**: A brief string detailing what changed (one line per version works well, e.g. `"1.1.0 - fixed crash\n1.0.0 - first release"`). The hub publishes it with the catalog and the device store shows it under a **"Novidades" / What's New** header on the update screen.

### Fields managed by the CelerOS Hub

When you publish through the hub (`tools/celerhub.py`), four
fields of `app.json` are computed and written by the server — **don't set them
by hand** (a manual publish overwrites them again):

- **`size`** — byte size of `main.js` (the store checks free disk space before downloading).
- **`md5`** — checksum of `main.js`; the device validates it after downloading and aborts the update on mismatch, leaving the installed version untouched.
- **`published_at`** — UTC timestamp of the publish.
- **`publisher`** — token name that published the package.

### App update rules (CelerOS Hub)

- **The catalog is the update channel.** The device store compares each catalog version against the installed one; newer versions show an **"Atualizar"** badge in the list, the **Atualizações** tab and the **"Atualizar tudo"** button.
- **Bump `version` on every publish.** The hub rejects versions ≤ the published one (`--force` to override, e.g. to republish a fixed package).
- **You own your `packageName`.** The first publisher becomes the owner; only the same token (or the hub root) can update or remove the package afterwards.
- **Size limits:** `main.js` ≤ **48 KB** on any board; declaring `"requires": ["psram"]` raises the ceiling to **128 KB** (the hub refuses bigger — boards without PSRAM can't compile a source that large). Apps above **30 KB** must declare `api: 6` (old firmware downloaded via `Net.get`, which truncates at 32 KB; the API 6 streaming downloader has no cap). `icon.png` ≤ 16 KB.
- **The icon ships with the update:** keep an `icon.png` (64×64 PNG, ≤ 16 KB) in the package — the store downloads it on install/update and the launcher refreshes its icon cache automatically.
- **Updates land in the folder the launcher runs** (resolved by `packageName`): updating a preinstalled app updates it in place instead of creating a shadow copy.
- **The App Store updates itself:** the store is a regular hub package (`celeros.appstore`). When the catalog has a newer store, it shows up like any update — after installing, the store asks to exit and reopen (the new `main.js` is read from disk on the next launch).

## 3. The `icon.png` File (App Icon)

A 64x64 (or larger, square) PNG shown in the Launcher. On install it is
decoded into the system icon cache (RGB565 + 4-bit alpha), so transparency
and rounded corners work. Apps without an `icon.png` get a generic icon.

## 4. The `main.js` File (App Logic)

The `main.js` file is the entry point of your application. When a user taps your app in the Launcher, the OS loads and executes this JavaScript file.

Because CelerOS handles the underlying C++ translation, you can write simple, high-level JavaScript to draw graphics, read files, and trigger UI components.

### The app model

* **ES5 only**: no arrow functions, `let`/`const`, `class` or template literals — the engine is Duktape. Use `var` + `function`.
* Your app is a **blocking `while` loop** with `System.delay()` — there are no events or callbacks. Everything is polling: `System.getTouch()`, `System.keypadPoll()`, `CelerLink.poll()`.
* All coordinates live in the **virtual 240x320 canvas** (`System.screenWidth()` is 240 everywhere); the OS scales to the physical glass. Pick colors from `System.theme()` instead of hardcoding.
* Exit with `System.exitApp()`. State you want to keep goes in `FS.appData()` (a private folder per app).

### Your First App (`main.js`)

Paints the background, writes a centered message, waits for a touch and
exits — with the real API (`System.*`, theme colors):

```javascript
var T = System.theme();

System.fillScreen(T.bg);
System.setTextColor(T.text);
var msg = "Hello CelerOS!";
System.drawString(msg, 120 - (System.textWidth(msg) >> 1), 150, 2);

// Wait for a touch (yielding shows the frame on the glass)
var t;
do {
    t = System.getTouch();
    System.delay(20);
} while (!t.touched);

System.exitApp();   // back to the Launcher
```

### Feature detection across boards

The same app runs on very different boards (a 4" PSRAM SmartDisplay, a
128 KB-RAM CYD, a robot dog). Feature-detect instead of assuming:

```javascript
if (System.getAPILevel() >= 9 && typeof CelerLink !== "undefined") {
    // Bluetooth LE link between CelerOS devices (API 9)
    var peers = CelerLink.scan();
    if (peers.length) CelerLink.connect(peers[0].id);
}

if (System.relayCount() > 0) System.relay(1, true);  // "Y" SKUs (API 8)
if (typeof System.gpio.servo === "function") System.gpio.servo(13, 90);  // API 10

var battery = System.battery();   // -1 on boards without a divider
var level = System.micLevel();    // -1 without a microphone
```

Board flags in `System.getInfo()` (`hasLed`, `hasLightSensor`, `hasSpeaker`)
and the `-1`/`false`/count returns of the hardware calls are the contract —
never assume a peripheral exists.

### Reference apps to read

* Bundled (`data/apps/`): **Snake** (game loop, persisted record), **Terminal**
  (docked keyboard `System.keypad*`), **Touch Test**, **HTTP Demo** (network).
* Hub (`hub_apps/`): **Celer Remote** (API 11) — a full robotics example:
  scans and connects over Celer Link, drives a D-pad that repeats
  `{type:"move",dir}` messages and shows the robot's telemetry.

## 5. SDK: from scaffold to publish

The development tools live in `tools/` in the repo, behind a single entry
point (`tools/sdk/celer.js`), with no dependencies to install. Recommended
flow:

```bash
# 1) create the skeleton (app.json at the current API level, sample main.js,
#    icon.png and celer.d.ts for VS Code autocomplete)
node tools/sdk/celer.js new MyApp

# 2) iterate locally: lint on every save, emulator with a screen preview
node tools/sdk/celer.js lint MyApp
node tools/sdk/celer.js emu MyApp            # saves MyApp/.dev/tela.png

# 3) dev loop on the device: watches files, reinstalls what changed,
#    terminates the running app (shell `exit`) and reopens it, with live logs
python3 tools/celerctl.py dev MyApp [--shots]

# 4) publish
node tools/sdk/celer.js publish MyApp --dry  # offline validation
node tools/sdk/celer.js publish MyApp
```

### Debugging on the device

Boards with the debugger (the ESP32-S3 ones by default:
`CONFIG_CELEROS_JS_DEBUGGER`) give you breakpoints, stepping and live
inspection of the running app:

```bash
python3 tools/celerctl.py debug MyApp     # opens the app paused on line 1 + REPL
```

```
dbg> b 42 if score > 100     # conditional breakpoint (line of the paused file)
dbg> w player                # watch: printed on every pause
dbg> c                       # continue until a breakpoint
dbg> v player                # objects show their content: {"x":12,"y":40}
dbg> lc                      # locals of the frame;  cs = call stack, up/down
dbg> e score * 2             # eval in the frame;  set lives 9 changes a var
dbg> n                       # step over (s = into, o = out, u 50 = run to line 50)
dbg> r                       # push your edited files + restart, keeping breakpoints
```

* An **uncaught error pauses at the throw**, with the stack and locals
  intact; `c` lets it proceed to the usual error screen.
* `debugger;` in your code pauses there while a debugger is attached (it is a
  no-op otherwise, but remove it before publishing).
* Ctrl-C pauses a running app; Ctrl-C twice (or `q`) detaches and the app
  keeps running. Device logs show up in the same terminal.
* Edit-and-retry loop: save in your editor, `r` in the REPL — the local app
  folder (found in `data/apps`/`hub_apps`, or `--src DIR`) is linted and the
  changed files are pushed before the restart; lint errors keep the old app.
  (`celerctl debug --serve` keeps only the proxy for a separate client.)

Worth knowing:

* **`celer.d.ts`** (generated by `tools/sdk/celer.js types`): API types for
  the editor — the scaffold copies it into the app folder along with a
  `jsconfig.json`. It is an artifact generated from the firmware source;
  after changing the API, regenerate and commit it (`celer.js check` flags
  drift in CI).
* **Emulator** (`emu`): runs the app in the Node harness with real drawing
  onto a 240x320 framebuffer and saves a PNG of the screen. It is an
  approximation (8x8 font, `drawPNG`/`drawBMP` not rendered) — the final
  screen is always the device's.
* **`test`/`emu` accept an event script**: create a `test.js` in the app
  folder exporting `wire(env)` (taps via `env.__harness.tap/pushTouch`,
  network responses, CelerLink state) and the runner injects it before
  running.
* **`celerctl dev`** negotiates 921600 baud by itself and keeps a keepalive
  with the device (the channel falls back to console after 8s without host
  traffic). The device shell's `exit` command cleanly terminates the running
  app — that is what enables reloading without a reboot.
